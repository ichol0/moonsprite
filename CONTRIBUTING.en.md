## Contribution License

Unless a separate written agreement applies, by submitting a contribution you represent that you have the right to provide it and agree that it will be distributed under the repository's current MoonSprite Source-Available License 1.0. You also grant the MoonSprite copyright holders a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use, modify, distribute, and sell official commercial binaries that include the contribution. You retain copyright in your own contribution.

## Development Process

1. Create a short-lived branch from `main` using the `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, or `docs/` prefix.
2. Read `AGENTS.en.md`, `docs/README.en.md`, and the contracts related to the task.
3. Write a specification before a feature, and reproduction steps plus a regression test before a bug fix.
4. Keep each commit focused and do not mix in unrelated formatting or refactoring.
5. Follow `docs/release/changelog-policy.en.md` and append every independently describable change in the batch to the canonical `CHANGELOG.md` without overwriting existing entries.
6. Complete the required checks before opening a pull request.

## Definition of Done

- Behavior matches the relevant contract.
- Bugs have automated regression coverage, and pixel algorithms use deterministic data assertions.
- UI work reuses the component library where possible and covers default, selected, disabled, and interactive states.
- View state is not written into document history, and coordinate conversion is not duplicated.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, Rust checks, and affected builds pass.
- Features, fixes, interactions, performance changes, refactors, dependencies, build changes, and platform changes are each recorded in the canonical `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Commit Format

Use Conventional Commits, for example:

```text
fix: keep selection aligned after rotating the view
feat: add project workspace export
docs: define brush alignment behavior
test: cover layer duplicate undo
```

Never force-push `main`. Keep dependency upgrades in separate commits and explain why each upgrade is needed and how it was validated.
